#Arduino Toggle Project

The purpose of this project is to read toggle position in order to translate it to LED power
##Setup

* We begin by connecting the Toggle to the correct pins on the Arduino
* We make sure to connect the LED's to the correct PWM Pins in order to have a variation in LED strength.
* Connect Ground to a 330 ohm resistor and connect all LEDs(left,right, up and down) with pins and ground
* Begin Coding as will be found within code file and upload code to IDE

##Usage

Open the Serial Moniter at 9600 baud and see the position of toggle and move to light up desired LED
